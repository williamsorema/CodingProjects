REVENGE OF ANGRY TACO MAN

Hello, and thank you for playing Revenge of Angry Taco Man! This game has been a production of Team 35:
Tom Mitchell
Connor Fossler
Bryant Arteaga
Williams Orema

The game should start fine just by running the executable.


A list of known, unfixed bugs:
The game lags for a split second when loading in new song tracks.

Repeatedly spamming the dash forward button will launch Angry Taco Man upward into the stratosphere.

The dash forward move can teleport Angry Taco Man inside buildings and other environmental assets. However, the player should be able to just walk out.

In some locations on the ground terrain, there are very small gaps in which the player can fall through the floor. I've tried to patch most of them but I am still, on occasion, discovering new gaps.
